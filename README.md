# calculator-project
This is my first calculator project that I developed a few months ago after watching some javascript, html and css lessons. It was my first "big" project that I made, so it's full of leftover code and things I wanted to implement but I couldn't figure out how. It has a very ugly code structure as well. It took something around 20hours in order to complete it entirely.

I don't know if the way it works is the most adequate, but I made it entirely from scratch and not looking at any other calculators on the internet, just to challenge myself. I am very satisfied with both the visuals and how it works, and I made it pretty much bugproof after some hours of "bug research", so it probably works just fine.

I have launched it in netlifly since I don't know how to host with github, so if you are curious to try it, check the link out https://calculator-project-char.netlify.app/ .What do you guys think about it?
