# calculator-project
That's my first "big" project that I made after learning some html css and js, so it's full of leftover code and things I wanted to implement but I couldn't figure out how. It has a very ugly code structure as well. It took something around 20hours in order to complete it entirely. I didn't look up at any references, so the logic behind should be a little messy.

What do you think? It has some different features from a normal calculator since I was testing some things out, but it should work just fine
